      "My involvement in the project began with our contract with Game Theory Games and i worked on new features and maintenance. \nI worked on refactoring the main state machine for player character behaviour. As new weapons were added to the game, state machine began to bloat and became mostly unmaintainable. \nI solved this problem by implementing a concurrent state machine design where player movement and weapon logic got handled in simultaneous state machines.\nI have also refactored the combo logic by encapsulating attacks into Command objects, adding them to a queue and checking for valid combos within a timeframe by using  a trie structure to lookup valid combos.\nCombo mechanic in this game required hits to be valid (hitting enemy colliders) and be in a specific sequence to enable another button to execute the combo. \nI have also worked on a total UI redesign phase where the game has a dark and light UI modes.\nAlso, i worked on daily rewards and subscription model implementations to increase user retention and revenue.\nI worked with the design team to implement and create new features for this game.",

    detailed_description:
      "As part of a European Union research programme with my university (BAP), my thesis focused on exploring the detrimental consequences of Urban Heat Islands (UHI) caused by rapid urbanization and inadequate government policies. UHI exacerbates resource consumption, environmental footprint, and poses risks to human health and comfort. I emphasized the need for new design and adaptation strategies in urban settlements to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact.\n\nTo investigate the thermal conditions under UHI effects, I utilized the Urban Weather Generator (UWG), a simulation package written in Python. This powerful tool allowed me to model and analyze the impact of various parameters on UHI intensity. The simulation incorporated geometric data created using Rhinoceros3D, a 3D modeling software, to accurately represent the urban environment.\n\nIn my research, I employed sensitivity analysis, a valuable method to measure the impact of input variables on the output. Sensitivity analysis helps identify the most influential parameters and understand their contributions to the overall UHI effect. It provides valuable insights for modeling, decision-making, and developing effective mitigation strategies.\n\nThrough global sensitivity analysis, I assessed UHI increase in a residential district in Ankara, Turkey, and identified the parameters that significantly contribute to UHI effects. By conducting simulations during average summer and winter weeks, I also explored the seasonal impact on UHI.\n\nThe findings of my thesis highlight the urgent need for sustainable urban development and offer valuable insights for mitigating the adverse effects of UHI.\n\nYou can also explore the source code of the project from the link on the upper right.",

      "Hollow Ocean is an art installation designed to offer a peek into the potential future transformations of marine environments.\n\nIn this project, the ocean is divided into six chapters, each representing a different aspect of death. The first chapter, Plastic Ocean, explores the invasion of aquatic life by man-made synthetic polymers. These plastics enter the food chain as both prey and predator, causing widespread death. The second chapter, Dark Ocean, delves into the darkest depths of the ocean floor where humans are drilling for petroleum. The third chapter, Phantom Ocean, reveals the devastating impact of overfishing, which has wiped out 90% of top predators in a relentless pursuit of seafood. The fourth chapter, Acid Ocean, examines the intricate and delicately balanced chemistry of the ocean, a salty womb that nurtures a plethora of creatures. However, even a slight increase in acidity can result in the loss of billions of lives. The fifth chapter, Stifled Ocean, portrays how both land and sea have been altered by human activity, with changes in temperature, salinity, and acidity stifling marine life. The final chapter, Hollow Ocean, is dedicated to the issue of global warming.",
